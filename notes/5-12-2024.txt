first make it for one person. 
rhino creates parameter.

Do we want to randomly generate at the start of program?

Rhino -> parameters -> designs -> rankings by users -> design pool -> random selection (two parents)
-> matrix random selection -> mutation -> output -> users


Interface / collecting data:
Rhino -> parameters -> designs -> rankings by users

Evolution algo:
design pool -> random selection (two parents)
-> matrix random selection -> mutation

output
mutation -> output 

Do we want to store the data per step to see?

Parameter for mutation (chance and multiplier for each parameter), admin platform

Use with one computer 

parameter for the ranking, admin platform 

put logic in python versus grasshopper? 

one computer -> votes on ranking basis -> logic in rhino -> render -> output gif in next round

look into detecting the parameters in the first round before evolution starts


Sebas Evolution scatch:
  - Can we create one combined parent pool? -> independent of Mother or Father the pool can be combined.
  - Select only 3 parent groups
    - You can make a "list"
  - Make sure to have the correct numbers in the right order for each parent.

Grashopper:
  - Concat >> to get values on one line
