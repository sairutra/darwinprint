# DARWINproject

## Overview

DARWINproject is an interactive 3D model designed to teach Darwin’s theory of evolution to primary school students. This project was developed in collaboration with AMS Institute to provide an engaging and educational experience using computational design techniques.

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Evolution Model**: Generates visual representations of evolutionary changes.
- **User-Centric Design**: Developed and iteratively tested with students to ensure usability and educational effectiveness.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Simplified and documented workflow to facilitate future enhancements.

## Tech Stack

**Python, Rhino, Grasshopper, Rhino-API**

## Development Highlights

- Full software development lifecycle, from requirement gathering to implementation.
- Designed and refined an interactive 3D evolution model based on Darwin’s principles.
- Conducted iterative testing and trials to optimize student engagement and learning outcomes.
- Documented the workflow comprehensively for future research and development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sairutra/darwinprint.git
   ```  
   or
   Download as ZIP and unpack:
   ![Download_ZIP](img/download_zip.png)
2. Open:
   Open ``open_in_rihno/darwinprint.3dm`` in Rhino 8.
   Lunch grasshopper and pen ``open_in_grasshopper/evolution_algorithm.gh``. Loading this file might take a while.

## How to use:

#### Get Rhino Controle Panel
Inside Grasshopper activate Remote Panel, if not active:
Mac: ``View > Remote Controle Panel``
Win: ``???``

Inside Rhino activate Grasshopper Container, if not active:
Mac: ``Window > Container > Grasshopper``
Win: ``???``

### Changing the model:

## Q&A:

Why is the model preview for gen 0 missing?
If model preview of Gen 0 is missing click "Reload Evolution" and "Delete Evolution".

How do I change the size of the plane grid?
Mac: ``File > Settings > Grid > Grid line count``
Win: ``???``
A value of 3000 should be sufficient.
